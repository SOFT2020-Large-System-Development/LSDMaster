# Assignment 3 - System Operations Contract
_Large Systems Development, Fall 2020_  
_**Team B**_

## Objective

**Sequence Diagram**  
Create sub-system sequence diagrams for your use case scenarios. The diagrams should have the actor and the two sub-systems.
Be sure there is traceability between use case scenario and the left side of
the sub-system sequence diagram.

**System Operations Contract**  
In a Java (or C# or other strongly typed language with support for remote objects) Write the system operations contracts as found in the sub-system sequence diagramâ€™s right side. Add the DTOs and ETOs needed. Use a package manager as Maven, Gradle, or NuGet that allows for compilation outside the IDE.

Do this in a project on GitHub.
Add inline documentation for all methods, DTOs, and ETOs.
